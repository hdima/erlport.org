Support for all recent versions of the languages
  ErlPort should work on any operating system (including Windows) on which
  Erlang, Python or Ruby works. The following versions of the languages are
  supported:

  `Erlang <http://erlang.org>`__
    Any Erlang version starting from R13B
  `Python <http://python.org>`__
    Any Python version starting from 2.5 (including Python 3)
  `Ruby <http://ruby.org>`__
    Any Ruby version starting from 1.8

Function calls between all the supported languages
  ErlPort supports consistent APIs to make function calls from Erlang to any
  external language and from any external language to Erlang. This base
  function call support also allows to create chains of calls and use Erlang as
  a middleware.

Message sending between all the supported languages
  **TODO**
Support for custom data types
  **TODO:** Instances of the same external language can use specific to the
  language data types.
STDOUT redirection for external languages
  **TODO:** External to Erlang languages redirect STDOUT to Erlang
