ErlPort is a library for `Erlang <http://erlang.org>`__ which helps connect
Erlang to a number of other programming languages. Currently supported external
languages are `Python </docs/python.html>`__ and `Ruby </docs/ruby.html>`__.
The library uses `Erlang port protocol
<http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/ports.html>`__ to simplify
connection between languages and `Erlang external term format
<http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html>`__ to set the common data
types mapping.
