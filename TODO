- For pages we should create Page objects with title, body and url (something
  else?). And all the Page objects should have access to a Site object
  with methods like get_global_menu_items and get_local_menu_items.

- We can add meta.info file to every directory with meta information about the
  directory. For example we can generate top level and local menus based on
  this meta infromation.
